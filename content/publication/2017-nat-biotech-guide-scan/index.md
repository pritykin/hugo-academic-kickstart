abstract = "We present GuideScan software for the design of CRISPR guide RNA libraries that can be used to edit coding and noncoding genomic regions. GuideScan produces high-density sets of guide RNAs (gRNAs) for single- and paired-gRNA genome-wide screens. We also show that the trie data structure of GuideScan enables the design of gRNAs that are more specific than those designed by existing tools."
