I am a postdoctoral researcher in [the Leslie lab](https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/labs/christina-leslie) in [Computational and Systems Biology Program](https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/programs/computational-biology) at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski). My main interest and expertise is in using applied statistics, machine learning, and efficient computer algorithms to address fundamental questions in biology by integrative analysis and interpretation of multi-dimensional data.
